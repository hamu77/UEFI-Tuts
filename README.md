I just realized that the original author has delete their repo hence the fork doesn't show the parent repo. I am keeping this in public domain, unless the original author contacts me and asks me to take it down, as someone might use it for learning purposes.

# Step by Step Tutorials on how to use the UEFI for OS Development from scratch

THIS IS WINDOWS BASED TUTS, BUT CODE SHOULD WORK IN LINUX AND MAC.

NOTE : You WILL need to change the makefile to work with Linux / MAC gcc compilers. I do not have Linux or Mac, so I have no way to test it. The line in the makefile "-Wl,-dll -Wl,--subsystem,10" is a WINDOWS gcc compiler line. You do not need it for Linux / Mac GCC versions.  

NOTE 2 : Thanks to FueledByOCHD for his contribution of making this readme file much better to read.

[MinGWx64 ( GCC )](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html) ( For windows, no cross-compiler needed )  

**NOTE :** This works in Windows. Cross-compiler is not needed. But in Linux GCC should still work.  

[OSFMount](https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html)
 

**NOTE :** The create image is there for your convenience. I include the EXE and source code to create your own drive.hdd file from scratch. It even has the code setup with a 40 Meg GPT/EFI partition. This way you can see how it works.  

I supplied the qemu bat file to launch qemu and load the drive.hdd file.
